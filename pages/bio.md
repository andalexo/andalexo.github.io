### Short

Andreas Alexopoulos is a PhD student of the University of Thessaly working on beam diagnostics at CERN. Currently he is involved with a novel beam profile detector which uses tracks from beam-gas interactions in order to reconstruct in a non-invasive fashion the beam profile.

Andreas Alexopoulos is a PhD student of the University of Thessaly working on beam diagnostics at CERN. Currently he is involved with a novel beam profile detector which uses tracks from beam-gas interactions in order to reconstruct in a non-invasive fashion the beam profile.

Andreas joined CERN as a Technical student and he was initially involved in the Cryogenic Beam Loss Monitors (CryoBLM) project. The project concerns the development of solid state (Si, Diamond) detectors that can work on temperatures as low as 2K so that they can be placed inside the LHC superconducting mangets and monitor the beam loss. In the context of his work, he developed the software for a custom acquisition system capable of receiving and displaying data up to a speed of 16MBps. He then participated in beam tests, radiating the detectors under investigation and collecting data. He also performed the analysis of the acquired data using information related to the beam profile and intensity, the deposited dose on the surface of the detectors and the detectors' response. Therefore, a complete characterization of the radiation damage of such detectors in cryogenic temperatures was made possible. His master's thesis concerned the above, entitled: "Cryogenic Semiconductor Detectors: Simulation of Signal Formation & Irradiation Beam Test"

Following the successful completion of a second irradiation test, Andreas took over a PhD project regarding a novel beam profile monitor, the Beam Gas Vertex (BGV) demonstrator.

Andreas Alexopoulos is a PhD student from the University of Thessaly. For the past 3 years he has worked in beam instrumentation topics such as beam loss, position and profile monitoring. Currently, he is involved in the Beam Gas Vertex project which concerns of a non-invasive beam profile monitor foreseen for the HL-LHC upgrade. Tracks of charged particles created by beam-gas collisions are tracked by scintillating fibers whose data are read out and processed on a CPU farm. Within a time interval the beam profile can be estimated by reconstructing the primary interaction vertices. His interests include image and video processing as well as the usage of high performance computing techniques for HEP data processing.
