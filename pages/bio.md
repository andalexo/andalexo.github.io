### One-liner
An inquisitive and passionate Computer and Data Scientist with a 5 year experience and a strong foundation in mathematics, problem solving, data analysis, software development and DevOps practices.

### Short

Andreas Alexopoulos is a PhD student of the University of Thessaly working on beam diagnostics at CERN. Currently he is involved with a novel beam profile detector which uses tracks from beam-gas interactions in order to reconstruct in a non-invasive fashion the beam profile.

### Medium

Somewhere in the middle.

### Long

Andreas Alexopoulos is a PhD student of the University of Thessaly working on beam diagnostics at CERN. Currently he is involved with a novel beam profile detector which uses tracks from beam-gas interactions in order to reconstruct in a non-invasive fashion the beam profile.

Andreas joined CERN as a Technical student and he was initially involved in the Cryogenic Beam Loss Monitors (CryoBLM) project. The project concerns the development of solid state (Si, Diamond) detectors that can work on temperatures as low as 2K so that they can be placed inside the LHC superconducting mangets and monitor the beam loss. In the context of his work, he developed the software for a custom acquisition system capable of receiving and displaying data up to a speed of 16MBps. He then participated in beam tests, radiating the detectors under investigation and collecting data. He also performed the analysis of the acquired data using information related to the beam profile and intensity, the deposited dose on the surface of the detectors and the detectors' response. Therefore, a complete characterization of the radiation damage of such detectors in cryogenic temperatures was made possible. His master's thesis concerned the above, entitled: "Cryogenic Semiconductor Detectors: Simulation of Signal Formation & Irradiation Beam Test"

Following the successful completion of a second irradiation test, Andreas took over a PhD project regarding a novel beam profile monitor, the Beam Gas Vertex (BGV) demonstrator.

### IPAC17

_[website](https://ipac17.org/)_

Andreas Alexopoulos is a PhD student from the University of Thessaly. For the past 3 years he has worked in beam instrumentation topics such as beam loss, position and profile monitoring. Currently, he is involved in the Beam Gas Vertex project which concerns of a non-invasive beam profile monitor foreseen for the HL-LHC upgrade. Tracks of charged particles created by beam-gas collisions are tracked by scintillating fibers whose data are read out and processed on a CPU farm. Within a time interval the beam profile can be estimated by reconstructing the primary interaction vertices. His interests include image and video processing as well as the usage of high performance computing techniques for HEP data processing.

### Konnecta

Andreas Alexopoulos is a Software Engineer / Data Scientist. He holds a Diploma in Computer & Communication Engineering from the University of Thessaly. He then joined the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) while following the MSc and PhD program of the same university. During his 5-year collaboration with CERN, he performed research and specialized in the development of beam diagnostics for accelerators. He was also involved with CERN's R&D groups (RD39, RD42) for the development of radiation hard solid-state detectors. His work focused on the design and implementation of the control, data acquisition and analysis software of various beam instrumentation diagnostics thus gaining solid experience in embedded systems, communication protocols and data science. For his PhD thesis he participated in the development of a novel detector measuring the beam size of the LHC and implemented the detector's real-time control, data acquisition and data processing software. His work has been published among others from Elsevier, American Physical Society (APS) and Institute of Physics (IOP) while he has published and presented in several conferences.
