***Welcome to our life little human; we've been expecting you.***


It is quite unreal how we are never going to be prepared for the feelings that come, no matter how long you are expecting it. Words are a poor means to express such feelings. But why not to keep a few so that I remember our life together.

The maternity hospital was allowing to have the baby at the room. We were also lucky since we have booked a 3-bed room but we were given a 2-bed one which was also empty for the first night. You were very calm and we all slept very well. How misleading that was ! The following night you... imrpessed and scared us with you voice and strength ! You were only a few hours old but had quite the appetite ! "She's assertive and demanding", they said; "Could be a good thing for her -just starting- life".
